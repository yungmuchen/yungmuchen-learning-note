Q: how to get free ca for ssh

A:
To get a free Certificate Authority (CA) for SSH (Secure Shell), you typically want to set up your own CA rather 
than get one from a public provider. SSH CAs are usually internal and used within organizations to simplify and 
secure key management. Here's how to create a free SSH CA using OpenSSH tools:

Step-by-Step: Create a Free SSH CA for SSH


1. Generate CA Key
On your secure CA machine (not exposed to the internet), generate a signing key:

  ssh-keygen -f ~/ssh_ca -C "SSH CA"

~/ssh_ca will be your private CA key (keep it safe).
~/ssh_ca.pub is the public CA key.


2. Distribute the Public CA Key to Clients and Servers
On every server where you want to allow CA-signed logins, add the CA public key to:
/etc/ssh/sshd_config

Add the following line:

  TrustedUserCAKeys /etc/ssh/ca.pub

Then restart SSH:

  sudo systemctl restart sshd

Place ca.pub in /etc/ssh/ca.pub.


3. Sign User SSH Keys with CA
When a user generates their SSH key:

  ssh-keygen -f user_key -C "user@example.com"

You (the CA) sign the public key:

  ssh-keygen -s ~/ssh_ca -I user_cert -n username -V +52w user_key.pub

-s ~/ssh_ca: your CA private key
-I: certificate identity
-n: valid principal (username on the target server)
-V: validity (e.g., 52 weeks)

This creates user_key-cert.pub, the signed certificate.

4. Use Signed Certificate
The user uses both the private key and certificate to connect:

  ssh -i user_key user@host

The SSH client automatically uses user_key-cert.pub.

5. (Optional) Use Host Certificates
You can also sign server host keys with your CA so clients can trust the server:

  ssh-keygen -s ~/ssh_ca -I server_cert -h -n server.example.com /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub

Add the resulting certificate in sshd_config:

  HostCertificate /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key-cert.pub

Summary
You don‚Äôt need a commercial or external CA for SSH. Use OpenSSH's built-in certificate support to:

-- Sign user and host keys.
-- Distribute and trust a single CA public key.
-- Easily rotate and expire credentials.

Let me know if you want a script to automate this process or help with integrating it into an environment.

Q: please explain CA, public key, and private key usage in a ssh server and ssh client handhsake.
How to deploy ssh keys to multiple servers so that each server can connect to other servers by key.


Great questions! Let‚Äôs break this down clearly in two parts:

‚úÖ Part 1: Understanding SSH with CA, Public Keys, and Private Keys

üîê 1. Public and Private Keys (Basic SSH)
Private Key: Stays on the client. It‚Äôs secret and used to prove your identity.

Public Key: Shared with the server. It allows the server to verify the client's private key.

üîë Typical SSH Flow Without CA
  a. A client (e.g., host1) has a key pair: id_rsa (private), id_rsa.pub (public).

  b. id_rsa.pub is copied to a server (e.g., host2) and added to:

  ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

  c. When the client connects via SSH, it proves possession of the private key.
  d. If the server finds the matching public key in authorized_keys, it grants access.

üè¢ 2. SSH with a Certificate Authority (CA)
Instead of distributing many public keys, you:

-- Create one CA private key (kept safe).
-- Distribute the CA public key to all SSH servers (TrustedUserCAKeys).
-- Sign user keys with the CA private key to generate certificates.
-- The servers trust any user keys signed by the CA.

Benefits:
-- Easier key rotation
-- Central control
-- Expiration and identity enforcement

ü§ù How SSH Handshake Works (Simplified)
Step	Action
1	Client initiates SSH connection.
2	Server sends its host key (or signed host certificate).
3	Client verifies host identity.
4	Client sends a public key or certificate.
5	Server checks if it trusts this key (via authorized_keys or CA).
6	If valid, server challenges the client.
7	Client proves it has the private key.
8	SSH connection is established.

‚úÖ Part 2: Deploying SSH Keys to Multiple Servers (Mutual Trust)
You want every server (say host1, host2, host3) to SSH into each other without a password.

üì¶ Option A: Using Shared Key Pair Across Servers (Quick and Dirty)
  a. Generate a keypair on host1:

    ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa -N ""

  b. Copy the same key and public key to host2 and host3:

    scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa* host2:~/.ssh/
    scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa* host3:~/.ssh/

  c. Add the public key to each server‚Äôs ~/.ssh/authorized_keys:

    cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

‚úÖ Now, any server can SSH to the others using the same identity.


üì¶ Option B: Use a CA to Sign Each Server‚Äôs Key (Better)
  a. Set up your CA (generate ssh_ca, ssh_ca.pub).
  b. On each server:
    -- Generate a host key if not already present.
    --  Sign the host key:

        ssh-keygen -s ssh_ca -h -n hostname -I hostname-cert -V +52w /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub

    --  Set in /etc/ssh/sshd_config:

        HostCertificate /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key-cert.pub
        TrustedUserCAKeys /etc/ssh/ca.pub

  c. For user keys (if each server has a service account or user like root, admin):
    --  Generate and sign a user key for each.
    --  Distribute certificates (user_key-cert.pub) to ~/.ssh/.

üìÇ Automating with ssh-copy-id
To push a key to many servers:

  ssh-copy-id user@host2
  ssh-copy-id user@host3
Or use Ansible, Fabric, or a Bash script for bulk operations.


Summary
Concept	Purpose
Private Key:	Proves identity (kept secret)
Public Key:	Used by server to verify identity
CA:	Signs keys to certify they‚Äôre trusted
Server Auth:	Server verifies user key (or cert)
Client Auth:	Client verifies server host key (or cert)

---------------------------------------------------------------
Below are two options to automate SSH key deployment between multiple servers so they can connect to each other via SSH without a password.

üß© Option A: Bash Script to Share One SSH Key Between All Servers
This approach:

-- Generates one SSH keypair on the first server
-- Pushes the public key to all servers‚Äô authorized_keys
-- Optionally copies the private key to each server so they all can connect to each other

üõ† Bash Script: setup_ssh_trust.sh

################### bash code ###########################

#!/bin/bash

# List of servers (replace with your actual hostnames or IPs)
SERVERS=("host1" "host2" "host3")

# User to connect as

KEY_NAME="$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa_cluster"

# Step 1: Generate SSH key if not exists
if [[ ! -f "$KEY_NAME" ]]; then
  ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -f "$KEY_NAME" -N "" -C "cluster_key"
fi

# Step 2: Copy public key to all servers' authorized_keys
for HOST in "${SERVERS[@]}"; do
  echo "Copying public key to $HOST..."
  ssh-copy-id -i "$KEY_NAME.pub" "$USER@$HOST"
done

# Step 3: Copy the private key to all other servers

  echo "Copying private key to $HOST..."
  scp "$KEY_NAME" "$USER@$HOST:~/.ssh/id_rsa"
  scp "$KEY_NAME.pub" "$USER@$HOST:~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
  ssh "$USER@$HOST" "chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa; chmod 644 ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
done

echo "SSH trust setup complete. All servers can SSH into each other using the shared key."

Security Note:
Sharing the same private key between all servers is easy but not ideal from a security perspective.

For production setups, use unique keys per server + an SSH CA for scalable trust.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Let‚Äôs walk through how to set up an SSH Certificate Authority (CA) and use it to manage authentication 
without sharing private keys. This method is secure and scalable, ideal for production environments.


Overview: SSH CA Setup & Deployment
You‚Äôll:

-- Create a CA key pair
-- Distribute the CA public key to all servers
-- Generate unique SSH key pairs per server or user
-- Use the CA to sign keys, issuing SSH certificates
-- Allow servers to trust only CA-signed certificates

üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step SSH CA Setup

üîê Step 1: Create the SSH CA (once)
Run this on your central, secure admin machine (not on the servers).

  ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/ssh_ca -C "SSH Certificate Authority"

ssh_ca = CA private key (KEEP SAFE)
ssh_ca.pub = CA public key (to be distributed to all servers)


üì¶ Step 2: Distribute CA Public Key to All Servers

On each server, add the CA public key to /etc/ssh/sshd_config:

  echo "TrustedUserCAKeys /etc/ssh/ca.pub" | sudo tee -a /etc/ssh/sshd_config
  sudo cp ~/ssh_ca.pub /etc/ssh/ca.pub
  sudo systemctl restart sshd


Or automate this using Ansible:

#### yaml ######
- name: Install CA public key on all servers
  hosts: ssh_cluster
  tasks:
    - name: Upload CA public key
      copy:
        src: ssh_ca.pub
        dest: /etc/ssh/ca.pub
        mode: '0644'

    - name: Configure sshd to trust the CA
      lineinfile:
        path: /etc/ssh/sshd_config
        line: "TrustedUserCAKeys /etc/ssh/ca.pub"
        state: present

    - name: Restart SSH
      service:
        name: sshd
        state: restarted

################

üë§ Step 3: Generate Per-User SSH Key (no sharing)
Each user generates their own key (or you generate it for them):

  ssh-keygen -f ~/user1_key -C "user1@example"

üîè Step 4: Sign the User Key with the CA
You (admin) use the CA private key to issue a signed SSH certificate:

ssh-keygen -s ~/.ssh/ssh_ca \
  -I user1-cert \
  -n user1 \
  -V +52w \
  ~/user1_key.pub


-s: sign with CA
-I: identity label (certificate ID)
-n: valid SSH usernames (principals)
-V: valid for 52 weeks
Output: user1_key-cert.pub


Step 5: Distribute the Certificate to the User

You send back:

-- user1_key (private key)
-- user1_key-cert.pub (SSH certificate)

They use them like this:

ssh -i user1_key user1@server1
SSH automatically uses the -cert.pub file if it‚Äôs present.


üß† Bonus: Host Certificates (Optional but Recommended)
You can also sign server host keys so that clients trust them without storing fingerprints.

ssh-keygen -s ssh_ca \
  -I host1-cert \
  -h \
  -n host1.example.com \
  -V +52w \
  /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.pub

Then configure sshd_config:

HostCertificate /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key-cert.pub

‚úÖ Benefits
Feature	Value
üéØ No need to distribute public keys to every server manually	
üßπ Easy to revoke or expire user credentials	
üîê Unique private keys per user = no risk of shared secrets	
üìú Signed identity and roles embedded in cert	
üõ°Ô∏è Simplifies zero-trust or ephemeral access models

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Below is a complete Bash script to automate the process of:

-- Generating a user SSH keypair
-- Signing it with your SSH CA
-- Copying the signed certificate and private key to a remote user/server

Bash Script: issue_ssh_cert.sh

########################################################################

########################################################################

üìù How to Use

-- Make sure you have the CA private key at ~/.ssh/ssh_ca.
-- Update USER, REMOTE_HOST, etc., to your setup.
-- Run the script:

chmod +x issue_ssh_cert.sh
./issue_ssh_cert.sh

üß© Optional: Add ~/.ssh/config Entry
On the remote host, you can simplify login with:


Host host1
  HostName host1.example.com
  User user1
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
  CertificateFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa-cert.pub

Result
The remote server:
-- Trusts your CA (TrustedUserCAKeys set in sshd_config)
-- Accepts only CA-signed user certificates
-- Each user has a unique private key + short-lived certificate

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here's a multi-user, multi-host version of the SSH certificate deployment script. This version:

-- Generates unique keypairs per user
-- Signs them with your SSH CA
-- Deploys the private key and signed certificate to multiple remote servers
-- Handles all users and hosts via configurable arrays
